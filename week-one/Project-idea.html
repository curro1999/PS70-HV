            <p class="black-text dark-blue-text">This project aims to develop a bioreactor tailored to the needs of producing technological beverages that rely on the fermentation of mixed cultures. Leveraging the expertise and technological tools available at Harvard, the plan is to construct a prototype based on two key approaches:
            <ul class="dark-blue-text">
                <li>Monitoring culture growth through optical density measurements.</li>
                <li>Using online sensors to track physical changes in the system.</li>
                <li>Study minimal cultures fermentation (1 bacteria + 1 Yeast) as a primary step.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <p class="pink-text bright-pink-text">PioReactor is a Canadian project that aims to make bioreactor science more accessible to a broader audience by offering a highly affordable product. The PioReactors are designed to monitor the growth of cultures in 15 ml vials. After establishing a relationship with the project's creator and proposing the idea of adapting his work to meet my needs through F4T, he found the proposal very interesting. Therefore, the idea is to build on the technical knowledge of the PioReactor, leveraging its software, user interface, and HAT, but expanding it to a 500 ml vessel and adding sensors to monitor physicochemical changes such as pH, pressure, dissolved oxygen, CO2, among others.</p>
