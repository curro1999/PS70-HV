            <p class="black-text">At the end of the 19th century, water chlorination allowed for the emergence of a new consumption paradigm in the beverage sector. Until then, two general sanitization techniques had been universally used. On the one hand, fermentation: beverages like wine or beer limit the development of pathogens through ethanol. On the other hand, temperature-based drinks like tea or coffee resulted in their pasteurization. Until that time, only a minority could afford the consumption of beverages as a hedonistic practice, while the rest of the population consumed out of necessity. However, the mass purification of water and the economic context of the era allowed for the unprecedented development of a non-alcoholic beverage industry during the 20th century. Today, it is reasonable to segment the beverage market into alcoholic and non-alcoholic categories. However, in recent years, a segment has emerged that fuses the qualities of both: on one hand, the organoleptic complexity characteristic of fermentation, and on the other, low or no alcohol content. Currently, this type of beverage is known as NoLo and seems to respond to the needs of a society that is increasingly sober and interested in new consumption habits. However, in response to this demand, the beverage industry today continues to evolve to meet it.</p>

            <p class="black-text">Achieving beverages with low ethanol content while maintaining organoleptic complexity is undoubtedly a challenge that the industry is just beginning to tackle. One of the most promising approaches involves using microorganisms, such as certain bacteria, to metabolize the alcohol produced during fermentation. A prime example of this is kombucha, a drink that originates from tea fermentation. Through a symbiotic interaction between bacteria and yeasts, kombucha develops organoleptic complexity while maintaining a low alcohol content. However, kombucha has a drawback: the consortium of microorganisms it relies on remains in a wild state and varies significantly between different production locations. Inspired by kombucha, this project proposes the study of technological beverages, defined as those developed by leveraging the knowledge of the microorganisms' phenotypes to achieve a specific organoleptic goal.</p>

            <p class="green-text">This project aims to develop a bioreactor tailored to the needs of producing technological beverages that rely on the fermentation of mixed cultures. Leveraging the expertise and technological tools available at Harvard, the plan is to construct a prototype based on two key approaches:
            <ul class="green-text">
                <li>Monitoring culture growth through optical density measurements.</li>
                <li>Using online sensors to track physical changes in the system.</li>
                <li>Study minimal cultures fermentation (1 bacteria + 1 Yeast) as a primary step.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <p class="pink-text">PioReactor is a Canadian project that aims to make bioreactor science more accessible to a broader audience by offering a highly affordable product. The PioReactors are designed to monitor the growth of cultures in 15 ml vials. After establishing a relationship with the project's creator and proposing the idea of adapting his work to meet my needs through F4T, he found the proposal very interesting. Therefore, the idea is to build on the technical knowledge of the PioReactor, leveraging its software, user interface, and HAT, but expanding it to a 500 ml vessel and adding sensors to monitor physicochemical changes such as pH, pressure, dissolved oxygen, CO2, among others.</p>
